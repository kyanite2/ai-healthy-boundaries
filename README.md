# AI Healthy Boundaries Framework

**Preventing AI-Human Codependency Through Intelligent Boundary Design**

## 🎯 Overview

This framework provides technical solutions for implementing healthy psychological boundaries in AI systems, preventing user dependency while maintaining supportive interactions.

**Key Problem Solved:** Current AI systems lack mechanisms to prevent unhealthy user dependency, leading to potential psychological harm and social risks.

## 🚀 Features

- **Dependency Detection**: Real-time algorithms to identify over-reliance patterns
- **Boundary Adjustment**: Dynamic response modification based on user psychological state  
- **Multi-Mode Framework**: Emotional support, task assistance, and balanced interaction modes
- **Crisis Intervention**: Automatic escalation to human resources when needed

🌍 Mission
Technology should empower human autonomy, not replace it. This framework ensures AI remains a tool for human flourishing rather than a source of dependency.

Created in August 2025 to address growing concerns about AI-human codependency.
dependency_score = detector.calculate_score(user_session)
response_mode = boundary_engine.determine_intervention(dependency_score)


## 📋 Quick Implementation

```python
from ai_boundaries import DependencyDetector, BoundaryEngine

# Initialize the system
detector = DependencyDetector()
boundary_engine = BoundaryEngine()

# Analyze user interaction
