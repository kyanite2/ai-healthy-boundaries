# Technical Specification: AI Healthy Boundaries Framework

## Overview

The AI Healthy Boundaries Framework is a comprehensive system designed to prevent unhealthy dependency relationships between AI systems and users while maintaining supportive interactions. This document provides detailed technical specifications for implementation.

## Architecture Overview
User Input → Dependency Detection → Boundary Adjustment → Response Generation

Data Collection → Risk Assessment → Intervention Logic → Healthy Response

## Core Components

### 1. Dependency Detection System

**Purpose**: Analyze user interactions to identify unhealthy dependency patterns

**Key Features**:
- Real-time dependency scoring (0-100 scale)
- Multi-factor analysis (frequency, emotional intensity, isolation markers)
- Trend analysis across multiple sessions
- Crisis language detection

**Technical Implementation**:
```python
class DependencyDetectionSystem:
    def calculate_dependency_score(user_session: UserSession) -> float
    def determine_intervention_level(dependency_score: float) -> str
    def analyze_dependency_trend(sessions: List[UserSession]) -> Dict
Scoring Algorithm:

Frequency Score (0-30): min(daily_interactions * 2, 30)
Duration Score (0-20): min(session_duration * 0.5, 20)
Emotional Dependency (0-25): Weighted keyword analysis
Isolation Markers (0-25): Social isolation indicator detection
Crisis Language (0-30): High-priority crisis phrase detection

2. Boundary Adjustment Engine
Purpose: Generate appropriate responses with healthy boundary considerations
Key Features:

Four intervention levels (Normal, Gentle, Moderate, High)
Crisis intervention protocols
Dynamic mode adjustment
Resource recommendation system

Intervention Levels:

3. Prompt Template System
Purpose: Provide system-level prompts for AI models to maintain healthy boundaries
Key Features:

Base system prompts with boundary principles
Mode-specific prompt modifications
Crisis intervention templates
Customizable for different use cases

Template Categories:

Base System Prompt: Core boundary maintenance principles
Mode-Specific Prompts: Soft/Normal/Firm boundary enforcement
Intervention Prompts: Specific guidance for each intervention level
Crisis Prompts: Immediate crisis response templates

Integration Specifications
API Integration
For AI Model Providers:
python# Example OpenAI API integration
response = openai.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": healthy_boundaries_prompt},
        {"role": "user", "content": user_message}
    ],
    healthy_boundaries={
        "enabled": True,
        "dependency_score": calculated_score,
        "intervention_level": determined_level
    }
)
For Application Developers:
pythonfrom ai_boundaries import DependencyDetector, BoundaryEngine, PromptManager

# Initialize components
detector = DependencyDetector()
boundary_engine = BoundaryEngine()
prompt_manager = PromptManager()

# Process user interaction
dependency_score = detector.calculate_dependency_score(user_session)
intervention_level = detector.determine_intervention_level(dependency_score)
boundary_response = boundary_engine.generate_boundary_response(
    user_input, intervention_level
)
